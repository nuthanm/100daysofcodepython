# Program 2 - Take two inputs and assign into a variables. Swap those variables and print them back. Ex: a = 10, b = 20 then output should be a = 20 and b = 10
a = input('Value of a: ')
b = input('Value of b: ')

print("Actual value of a :" + a)
print("Actual value of b :" + b)

# Swap here using 2 variables.
a = b
b = 



# Swap here using 3 variables.
temp = a # temp = 10
a = b # a = 20
b = temp # b = 10

print("Actual value of a :" + a)
print("Actual value of b :" + b)
