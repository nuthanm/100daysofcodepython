#Day 1 - Explained what, why, how print helps in python

# What is print?
# 1. print command is used to display on what we want to see in console window. Ex: If you want to see the name then write the following line.
print('Nani')

#Note: All statements in python are Case-Sensitive Ex: p or P both are different.

# 2. You can print the statement either use '(Single Quote) or \"(Double Quote). Ex: 'Nani' or 'Potti'.

print('Use with singal Quote')
print("Use with double quote")
print('Both \'single\' and "double" in single print statement')

# Note: Python follows no semi colon at the end of the each line and its not mandatory to follow.')

#3. If you type Print('something')then it throws an error: NameError: name 'Print' is not defined

#4. Using single print function to print multiple text in new line using \\n

print("Hello Potti\nHow are you?")

#5. Concatinate two strings using '+' symbol")
print("Nani " + " Potti")
