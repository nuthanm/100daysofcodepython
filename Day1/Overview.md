## Day 1 - Learn following concepts

1. Print and Input functions

2. Partial data type and purpose

3. Experienced with set of erros while writing the code and maintained errors inside common folder in this repository.

4. Sample project


**Day 1** - I learnt what, why and how to use 
  **print** command

  **input** command

  **string** datatype and its len() - find lenght of charecters in string

  **variables** - Used to store and reuse it through out the application
  
**what** - *print* is a function to use display any content like text message, addition(Expressions/Mathematical) in console window.

**why** - If you want to see some calculation like 10 + 20 = 30 in console then use *print* and it is one example. If you want to read and print the input what you type in console then use this function

**how** - *print(<any_content>)*

Ex: 
print("Hello Nani")

**o/p: Hello Nani**

print('Hello Potti')

**o/p: Hello Potti**

Both gives result output

print(10+20) 

**o/p: 30**

Print(10+20)
**o/p: throws an error: NameError: name 'Print' is not defined**
