# 100daysofcodepython

In this repository, I am going to add what i learnt during this 100 days of code in python on each day, 
- What i learnt in terms of concept
- **Examples** in Day wise folder with python files
- Reference 
  - Videos
  - Cheatsheets
  - Code snippets
  - many  more for learning purpose.
  
**Day 1** - I learnt what, why and how to use 
  **print** command

  **input** command

  **string** datatype and its len() - find lenght of charecters in string

  **variables** - Used to store and reuse it through out the application
  
**what** - *print* is a function to use display any content like text message, addition(Expressions/Mathematical) in console window.

**why** - If you want to see some calculation like 10 + 20 = 30 in console then use *print* and it is one example. If you want to read and print the input what you type in console then use this function

**how** - *print(<any_content>)*

Ex: 
print("Hello Nani")

**o/p: Hello Nani**

print('Hello Potti')

**o/p: Hello Potti**

Both gives result output

print(10+20) 

**o/p: 30**

Print(10+20)
**o/p: throws an error: NameError: name 'Print' is not defined**

** Multiple ways we acheive comments in python **

**'#'** - Use it for single line comments.

Ex: # Program 1 - Enter your name as an input.

**'''**
 Use this for multi line comments.
**'''**

Ex:
'''
Program - Write add function 

Inputs: a, b and only it should be integer.

Outut: a + b 

Ex: a = 10, b = 20 and Output is 30

'''

**Note:** python is case-sensitive **Ex: p or P** both are different
